This file contains a Garment Simulator. This was created by Nathanael Germain for CSC325.

In this design I used the abstract factory design method. This allows for someone to add new types of garments very easily.

This did lead to issues of the actual layout of the file itself being very messy. I chose to organize to separate the factory methods and the garment methods.

This code does not actual achieve anything and moreso serves the purpose of demonstrating the abstract factory design pattern in a use case for garments.
